%BROKENENROLL Breaks a minutia set into random smaller minutia sets
%   In order to store matchable minutia, without exposing the original
%   minutia set,  this function will break a minutia set into ${ShapeCount}
%   smaller minutia sets, each with ${PointCount} minutia.
%   Each smaller minutia set will be translated so that one of the points
%   is at 0,0 with a rotation of 0.  MinutiaSets contains the translated
%   minutia sets, and StraightMinutiaSets contains the minutia sets before
%   translation (for debugging).
